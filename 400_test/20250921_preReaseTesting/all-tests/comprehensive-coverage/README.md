# Comprehensive Coverage Tests (T210-T220)

This directory contains references and links to the comprehensive security test suite that covers the final phase of testing (T210-T220).

## Test Coverage Summary

### Phase 8: Comprehensive CLI Coverage (T210-T220)

#### Security and Validation Tests:

- **T210**: Input sanitization tests - Validates all user inputs are properly sanitized
- **T211**: SQL injection prevention - Tests protection against SQL injection attacks
- **T212**: Command injection prevention - Validates protection against command injection
- **T213**: Path traversal prevention - Tests prevention of directory traversal attacks
- **T214**: Environment variable validation - Validates environment variable handling
- **T215**: Configuration tampering detection - Tests detection of config file modifications
- **T216**: Sensitive data exposure prevention - Validates sensitive data protection
- **T217**: Audit trail verification - Tests audit logging functionality
- **T218**: Access control validation - Validates permission and access controls
- **T219**: Cryptographic operation validation - Tests cryptographic functions
- **T220**: Vulnerability scanning simulation - Simulates security vulnerability scans

## Running Security Tests

To run all security tests from this directory:

```bash
# Run all security tests
node ../../../security-tests/run-all-security-tests.js

# Run individual test categories
node ../../../security-tests/input-validation/t210-input-sanitization-test.js
node ../../../security-tests/injection-prevention/t211-sql-injection-test.js
node ../../../security-tests/access-control/t218-access-control-test.js
```

## Integration with Full Test Suite

These security tests represent the final phase of comprehensive testing and should be run after all other test phases have been completed successfully:

1. **Phase 1-5**: Basic functionality and parameter management
2. **Phase 6**: Advanced features (T151-T180)
3. **Phase 7**: Extended features (T181-T210)
4. **Phase 8**: Security validation (T210-T220) ← **This phase**

## Test Prerequisites

Before running security tests, ensure:

1. All previous test phases have passed
2. Test environment is properly configured
3. Network connectivity is available for RPC tests
4. Proper permissions are set for file system tests
5. Valid wallet and token addresses are configured

## Expected Outcomes

All security tests should pass to ensure:

- ✅ Input validation is working correctly
- ✅ Injection attacks are prevented
- ✅ File system access is controlled
- ✅ Sensitive data is protected
- ✅ Audit trails are maintained
- ✅ Cryptographic operations are secure

## Notes

- Security tests may take longer to complete due to comprehensive validation
- Some tests may require specific network conditions or permissions
- Failed security tests indicate potential security vulnerabilities that must be addressed
- These tests use the same masking patterns as other test files for sensitive data
