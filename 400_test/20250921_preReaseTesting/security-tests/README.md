## Prerequisites

Before running the tests, ensure you have:

1. **Node.js** (version 12 or higher)
2. **Tributary CLI** application built and accessible
3. **Test Environment** with appropriate permissions
4. **Configuration Values** (see Configuration section below)

## Configuration

**IMPORTANT**: Before running any tests, you must update the configuration in each test file:

1. Replace `YOUR_TOKEN_ADDRESS_HERE` with your actual token address
2. Replace `YOUR_ADMIN_WALLET_ADDRESS_HERE` with your actual admin wallet address
3. Update `./path/to/your/cli.js` with the correct path to your Tributary CLI executable
4. Verify the network setting matches your test environment

### Example Configuration Update

```javascript
const config = {
    targetToken: '4kmRpPn15Wn8Kgn65MLEMP291RLmV9wVX4ihBwNWbyvJ', // Your actual token
    adminWallet: 'D8zGvbM3w6bcAsnfWcZnWEz2GLeK7LPVftqwsMDCkcHk', // Your actual wallet
    network: 'testnet',
    cliPath: '../../../200_src/dist/cli.js' // Correct path to your CLI
};
```

## Usage

### Running All Tests

Execute the complete security test suite:

```bash
npm install
node run-all-security-tests.js
```

node input-validation/t214-environment-validation-test.js

# Injection prevention tests
node injection-prevention/t211-sql-injection-test.js
node injection-prevention/t212-command-injection-test.js
node injection-prevention/t213-path-traversal-test.js

## Security Domains Tested

| Domain | Tests | Coverage |
|--------|-------|----------|
| **Input Validation** | T210, T214 | XSS, Command Injection, SQL Injection, Path Traversal, Environment Variables |
| **Injection Prevention** | T211, T212, T213 | SQL, Command, and Path Traversal injection attacks |
| **Access Control** | T215-T219 | Configuration security, data exposure, audit trails, access validation, cryptography |
| **Vulnerability Scanning** | T220 | Buffer overflow, format string, memory corruption, unicode attacks |

## Best Practices

### Test Environment

1. **Isolated Environment**: Run tests in an isolated environment to prevent interference with production systems
2. **Test Data**: Use test-specific tokens and wallets, never production credentials
3. **Network Isolation**: Use testnet or isolated network environments
4. **Resource Monitoring**: Monitor system resources during vulnerability tests

### Security Considerations

1. **Credential Management**: Never commit real credentials to version control
2. **Test Isolation**: Each test creates its own isolated environment
3. **Cleanup**: Tests clean up temporary files and configurations
4. **Logging**: Comprehensive logging for security analysis and debugging

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Configuration Errors**: Ensure all placeholder values are replaced with actual configuration
2. **Path Issues**: Verify the CLI path is correct and executable
3. **Permission Errors**: Ensure proper file system permissions for test execution
4. **Network Timeouts**: Some tests may timeout due to network issues - this is often expected behavior

### Debug Mode

Enable verbose output by setting environment variables:

```bash
DEBUG=true node run-all-security-tests.js
```

## Contributing

When adding new security tests:

1. Follow the existing test structure and naming conventions
2. Include comprehensive documentation and comments
3. Mask all sensitive values with placeholder constants
4. Provide detailed output analysis and recommendations
5. Update this README with test descriptions
